# Advent of Code â€” 2022


## Notes

### Setting up dev environment

Installed python3, python3-pip, ipython3. Creating a python script (`generate.py`) that will copy over the files according to a template (inside the `./templates` folder).

Prepending python files with `#! /usr/bin/python` and running `chmod +x foo.py` (replace foo with file name) so that I can run the script by typing `./foo.py`
